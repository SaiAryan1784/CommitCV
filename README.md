# CommitCV: AI-Powered GitHub Project Ranking for Job Applications
Overview

CommitCV is an intelligent tool that analyzes job descriptions and ranks your GitHub repositories based on relevance. By leveraging the GitHub API and a locally hosted Large Language Model (LLM), CommitCV helps developers identify which of their projects best match specific job requirements.
Key Features

    GitHub Integration: Fetches repository details, including README files, programming languages, and assigned topics using the GitHub API.
    Local LLM Processing: Uses an offline LLM to analyze job descriptions and extract key skills and requirements.
    Project Ranking: Automatically scores and ranks repositories based on their relevance to a given job description.
    Tech Stack Analysis: Identifies technologies used in each project to improve ranking accuracy.
    Privacy-Focused: Runs the AI model locally, ensuring data security and eliminating reliance on external AI services.

How It Works

    Authenticate with GitHub using a personal access token to fetch repository data.
    Input a job description, which the LLM processes to extract key requirements.
    Analyze repositories using README content, programming languages, and topics.
    Rank projects based on their alignment with the job description.

Tech Stack

    Frontend: React (Next.js)
    Backend: Express.js (Node.js)
    Database (if needed): MongoDB
    AI Component: Local LLM (e.g., Llama, GPT4All, Mistral)
    Authentication: GitHub Personal Access Token

Future Enhancements

    Implement OAuth for seamless GitHub authentication and better rate limit handling.
    Improve ranking algorithms using embeddings and advanced NLP techniques.
    Add resume generation based on ranked projects.
    Export ranked project lists in various formats (PDF, JSON, etc.).
